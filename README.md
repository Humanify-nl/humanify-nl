### Hello there!

This repo is a small public collection of my work, from the past five years as a solo dev.
Some of it is new, some it is ported from my old bitbucket repo.

#### Content:
```
- Wordpress theme boilerplates
- ACF implementation
- Gutenberg block editor experiments
```
#### About me:
I am an allround Wordpress theme builder with a UX background. You could call me a UX developer.
I have a masters degree in HFE psychology with a big passion for usable websites, and developed my coding over the past six years, and run a solo business to build websites for my clients.
