### Hello there!

This repo is a small public collection of my work from the past five years as a solo dev.
Some of it is new, some it is ported from my old bitbucket repo. I am currently (as of sept '21) reorganising and adding to this repo.

#### Content:
```
- Wordpress theme boilerplates
- ACF implementation
- Gutenberg block editor experiments
```
#### About me:
I am an allround Wordpress theme builder with a UX background. You could call me a UX developer.
I have a masters degree in Human Factors Engineering Psychology and a big passion for creating usable websites. I have autodidactically developed my coding over the past six years, and run a solo business to build websites for my clients. 

I aim to contribute to WordPress as much as I can, to help make the block editor interface less confusing, and more intuitive, from both perspectives of power-user and developer.
